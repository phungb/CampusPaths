# Tests if an edge can be added to a graph with two nodes

# Create a graph
created graph one_edge_graph

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n1 to one_edge_graph
added node n2 to one_edge_graph

# Add an edge
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in one_edge_graph

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
the children of n1 in one_edge_graph are: n2(e1)
